        <p class="updated">Updated July 8, 2024</p>
        
        <p>I was born in London, UK and now live in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
        
        <p>I founded Los Feliz Engineering, a consumer software company named after the first neighbourhood I moved to in the U.S. We created Honk, a real-time messaging app, and Family, a self-custody Ethereum wallet. In September 2023, LFE was acquired by Avara, formerly known as Aave Companies, where I now serve as CPO.</p>
        
        <p>I also co-founded Dip. We create and publish tools for achieving interface excellence, such as cmdk.</p>
        
        <p>I consider myself a designer at heart and enjoy building highly polished products.</p>
